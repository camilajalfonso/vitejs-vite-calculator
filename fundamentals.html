        <h2>What is the Web?</h2>
        <p>The Web is the common name for the <i>World Wide Web</i>, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.</p>
        <p>Web pages are formatted in a language called <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> (HTML). It this language that allows users to click through pages on the Web via links. The Web uses HTTP protocol to transmit data and share information. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are used to access Web documents, or Web pages, which are connected via links.
            The Web is just one of the ways that information is shared over the Internet; others include email, instant messaging and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p>
